# OOSE Assignment 1: Dots

This is the front end for [assignment 1][Assn1] where you'll create an implementation of the classic game, [Dots][UCLA-Dots]. A working implementation can be found deployed on Heroku [here][Heroku-Dots].

Download this repository as a .zip and unpack it in the `src/main/resources/public/` directory of your project. You can use the [Todo app][Todo] as a starting point to help you get running with Spark.
