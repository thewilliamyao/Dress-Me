---------------------------------------------
**Group: 5**

### Attendance: anyone missing?
Nope.

### Overview of project: clearly explained and understandable?
Yes.

### Demo: clear?
The demo only showed two views (recommendation and closet) with almost no transitions, but you did describe what you're going to have very clearly.

### Architecture explained? General structure of code at this point explained?
You mentioned what frameworks/technologies you're using, but the structure of the project itself could be explained in more details (for example where does the "dress me" recommendation happen, the workflow of this algorithm, etc.).

### Presentation organization, both in terms of logistics and quality of slides, properly taking turns, demo going smoothly, etc.
Good.

### Project comments we noticed during presentation:
There is a good chance that your three recommendations will be the same a lot of times.

**Group 5 Grade:  94/100**
