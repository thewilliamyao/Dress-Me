# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 5

**Evaluator: [Xu, Jizhou](mailto:jxu55@jhu.edu)**



## Positive Points:

* Clear vision statement.
* Detailed and specific features and use-cases.


## Things to Improve:

### Using Weather Data to Pick Outfit

One of your main features, picking outfit based on weather data, isn't very detailed. You need to explain a bit more how it would work, such as any specific algorithms or what objectives you're trying to maximize.

*(-1 point)*

### UI Sketches

Your UI sketches gave a good sense of how the app will look and how users will interact with it. However, while I was able to see how each view works individually, there's little information on the relation between the views. It's kind of difficult to tell which button leads to where or how to get to a certain view.

*(-1 point)*

### Architecture

We specifically said that Node.js was not allowed as a backend, so you need to pick another one. Although you're clear on which technologies, frameworks, etc. you're going to use, you didn't provide any proposal on the structure (major packages, components, etc.) of the app, please be more clear in future iterations.

*(-15 points)*



## Suggestions:

### Integration the Weather API

Looks like the API you were going to use requires the location of the user. I recommend you to prototype something and see whether you want to use the current location provided by the user's smart phone or have the user manually enter the location info.



## Overall:

Good job! Keep it up and your project should be in a good shape. In the future, please make a separate page for each iteration.
