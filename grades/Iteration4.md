# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 5

**Evaluator: [Xu, Jizhou](mailto:jxu55@jhu.edu)**

## Needs work issues (-12)
Authentication is still not in place. Laundry screen and closet screen both still filled with dummy data. Recommendation screen didn't change from the overview presentation (still just plain words instead of the dressed up figure you initially planned). The only major thing that seem to work is the get recommendation call.

## Code (-2)
Your "getRecommendation" function is very messy (basically just if-else statements for all types of clothes, I would really refactor this part in future iterations).

## Tests

###  Good code coverage?
You covered the main functionalities in your backend tests. However, since you have a relatively complex interface, it would be nice to have some frontend tests in place.

### Travis works?
Looks good to me.

## Build / run / deploy

### Clear scripts for both build/run and deploy?
Yes.

### Grader could fire up and run project?
Yes.

## Github

### Use of Github
Your broke up your working into branches that logically make sense (refactor, postgres database), and it was really easy for me track your progress on each of these sub domains. Feel free to close resolved issues, and really prioritize your remaining ones.

## Iteration Plan
Your iteration 5 plan is still really vague. Since it's your work that matter the most, I'm not penalizing you here, but you have a lot features to work on. When we see your final demo, we will expect you have your frontend fully hooked up with the backend.

## Code Docs
Good.

## Overall Comments
You're a little behind on progress, but we've got enough time left. Please really use these last few days to refine your project.

**Grade: 86/100**
