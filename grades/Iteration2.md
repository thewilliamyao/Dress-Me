# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 5

**Evaluator: [Xu, Jizhou](mailto:jxu55@jhu.edu)**



## Positive Points:

* Good archetecture description.
* UML seems to be implementable and demonstrated nice OO design.
* Very complete API specs.


## Things to Improve:

Although we mainly focus on refining the project plan for iteration 2, you could've done a bit more basic prototyping such as setting up some important endpoints.

*(-2 point)*

## Suggestions:

It looks like you guys have some frontend templates in place. Try get your server up and running and achieve some basic features that's showable on the frontend (i.e. build a minimum viable product), because by doing this you can quickly get comfortable with the whole flow of how your app is going to work.

## Overall:

Nicely done!

** Grade: 98/100 **

## Points back (the maximum you can get back is 1/2 of what was took off):

### Architecture (+2)
### UI Sketches (+0.5)
