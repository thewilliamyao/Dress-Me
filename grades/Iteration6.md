#### Group Number: 5 Dress Me!

#### Presentation

Very good - clearly stated goals.

You also addressed the issues of having same recommendations all the time, and your recommendation algorithm took users' feedback into account.

##### App demo comments.  Did any errors/glitches arise during the demo?

  - Generally good

  - Passwords /not/ in plain text! :)

  - Inputting the initial data is hard for users.

  - Icons for all types of clothing are the same.

  - Good looking animations and background and all.

  - No way to differentiate between clothing items. For example, matching
    colors.
  
  - Sometimes when you readjust the recommendation, some cloth types in the recommendation list become "NONE". You might have set the app to behave this way but it's bad user experience.

##### UI quality -- look and usability

Very nice

#### Iteration 6

##### Code inspection

##### Architecture - was the code cleanly structured in terms of packages, deployment, etc

 - React Native - good to try out this cutting-edge framework.

 - Factoring into 3 different controllers - good

##### Tests - good coverage?  Travis working?

Main features seem to have good coverage.

##### Final code documentation

Good. You cleaned up your code and have a reasonable amount of comments explaining how some functionalities work.

##### GitHub usage

Still many active branches hanging but other than this, good.

#### Project difficulty in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion

Looks decent on the non-CRUD oart, you did put some effort into the algorithm.

#### Overall remarks

Overall this was a solid project, it was a touch short on features for a four-person group however.

**Grade: 90/100**
