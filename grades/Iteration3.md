# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 5

**Evaluator: [Xu, Jizhou](mailto:jxu55@jhu.edu)**



## Positive Points:

* A relatively complete description of your current progress.
* Good for you to have found a working API for the weather information and integrated it into your app.


## Things to Improve:

There seems to be some logic behind your "getRecommendation" algorithm, but there isn't much thought put into it engineering wise (just a bunch of really simple if-else checks). Also, as mentioned in the iteration requirement, we wanted to see some tests for core features, the tests you have don't cover the "getRecommendation" logic at all. Although this is a class project, we would still like you to apply all your best software engineering practices to your code. Keep this in mind, and make some improvements in the refactoring iteration.

*(-2 point)*

Your iteration plan although has several different points, but it's very generic (for example, what "other screens" are you going to design, and what does "changing screens" mean?). In terms of user authentication, don't waste too much time on it if you can find some working examples. It's not your main focus after all :)

*(-3 point)*

You didn't mention what you plan to do in iteration 5 and 6. As mentioned in the requirement page, "So in this iteration (3), propose what issues you plan to tackle in iterations 4-6."

*(-2 point)*



## Suggestions:

Your frontend needs a lot of work. Try getting it hooked up with the backend soon.



## Overall:

Now we're moving into the serious coding portion of the project, please make sure every member of your group knows his responsibilities and each of you has something to contribute.

** Grade (with points back from iteration 1): 93/100 **
